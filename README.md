# CryptoClustering

Challenge 19 - Crypto Clustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## The Final Output

The final project is contained in Crypto_Clustering.ipynb Jupyter Notebook

## Stages of this project:

* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
* Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
